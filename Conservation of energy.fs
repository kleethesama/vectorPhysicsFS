module conservationOfEnergy
(* The relation used for these functions is: 0.5 * m * v^2 = m * g * h
Which is the equation for conversation of energy,
and only applies in situations where there is a conservative force like gravity,
and where the gravitational acceleration can be considered constant (Near the surface of Earth). *)
