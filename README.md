# vectorPhysicsFS

Just a small physics-programming project that focuses on using vectors as quantities. So far, there are functions for conservation of energy (mostly gravity based problems), simple vector algebra, and functions that describe the motion of projectiles. There will probably be added more functions as time goes on, perhaps even a simple grapical user interface.
